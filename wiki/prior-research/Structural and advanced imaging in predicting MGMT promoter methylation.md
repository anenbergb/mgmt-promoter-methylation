## Summary
* 92 patients with GBMs
* MRIs with diffusion-weighted (DWI), 3-d arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL)
* Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
* Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) 
* From the ADC and rCBF measurements within the region of interest (ROI), authors conclude that itâ€™s possible to predict MGMT status.
* MGMT promoter methylation associated with increased ADC and decreased rCBF
