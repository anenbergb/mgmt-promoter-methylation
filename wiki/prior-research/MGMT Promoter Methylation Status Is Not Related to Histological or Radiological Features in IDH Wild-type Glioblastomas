## Summary
* Study concludes that MRI imaging features cannot be used to noninvasively predict MGMT promoter methylation status because MGMT status is not related to the phenotypical biology in IDH wild-type GBMs.
* They evaluate the relationship between MGMT status and phenotypical tumor biology. Look for 22 histopathological features, immunohistochemical proliferation index, microvessel density measurements, conventional magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, preoperative speed of tumor growth, and overall survival. None of the investigated histological or radiological features were significantly associated with MGMT status. 
* Also conclude that the MGMT status is not correlated with a less aggressive tumor biology.
* Only 85 patients in study
